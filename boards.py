"""
So far, we have developed an interactive version of the Battleship game.
For ease of execution, we simplified the game board to an 8Ã—8 grid and randomly placed three ships at the start, with lengths of 2, 3, and 4 units respectively. 
The player inputs the coordinates of their desired attack step by step, and the terminal provides a visualized board along with feedback messages. 
Upon successfully sinking a ship, the surrounding cells are updated according to the initial placement rules to prevent invalid or redundant attacks.

# LOG: setup the size and initialize the board for the Battleship game
# The board size is set to 8x8 for the Battleship game.
#each cell have 5 different state
# 0 for not hit empty cell
# 1 for hit empty cell (miss)
# 2 for hit ship cell (hit)
# 3 for not hit ship cell
# 4 for hit ship cell and sunk (sunk)
# The board will be represented as a 2D list of integers, where each integer represents the state of the cell.
# then the ship sunk, cells around ship will mark as 1 (miss) directly since it's not allow to place ships around eachothers
